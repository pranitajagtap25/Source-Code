The Krushi Seva system was abolished to stop the exploitation of the farmers. After the abolition of Krushi Seva system, the land got divided into small parts and the farmers were the owners of those small part of the land. This has caused a decrease in the production of large crops. During the green revolution the government introduced a new act called APMC act. According to  this act, farmers could sell their produce in the Mandi system. This system includes a trade between a trader and a farmer along with a licensed middleman where these middlemen obtain commission from both the trader as well as the farmer. Thus, the middleman is the one who works for the commission and this was the failure of the system. In the system, the farmerâ€™s produce will be put in auction and the trader who pays high for the produce will get the produce of the farmer which was thought to get profit for the farmer. The middlemen purchased the farmers produce at very low rates and started to sell these produces at the higher rates for the traders which caused a loss for the farmers as they were underpaid.
